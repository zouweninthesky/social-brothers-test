# Assessment for [Social Brothers](https://socialbrothers.nl/).

## Assessment

Create SPA with React.
"The intention is that you can make blogpost in the left corner, you can use our API where you can save these messages. In the right corner you have to view the latest blogposts. When you click the button ‘meer laden’ it’s important to load more messages in the container. Also, there is an archive for all blogposts."

## How to try

To install the app you will require [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads), [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) и [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).\
Once you have them, create a folder where it's convenient for you and open it with the terminal ("Command Line Interface" in Windows).\
Once there, enter this command: `git clone git@github.com:zouweninthesky/social-brothers-test.git`.\
When the project will load, get deeper, into the project folder with `cd social-brothers-test` and type in `npm i` to install the packages required to run the app.\
When the packages load, type in `npm start`.\
After that the app will open in your default browser and you will be able to use it.
